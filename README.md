Hey! This is my site, which I created when I was learning the Java backend technology stack.
Here such technologies were used as:
<ul>
    <li>Spring boot - as the main framework</li>
    <li>Spring MVC - for routing and processing requests</li>
    <li>JSP + JSTL - for server-side rendering of templates</li>
    <li>Hibernate - for working with the database, and the database itself was postgreSQL</li>
    <li>Spring security - for registration and authorization, and generally work with the user</li>
    <li>Java email sender - to send a letter to the mail with the purpose of its confirmation</li>
    <li>Bootstrap and jQuery were used on the frontend</li>
</ul>

Here is a video demonstrating how the site works:
